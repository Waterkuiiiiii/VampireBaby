## ***MissingN FINO Features***

### [***About MissingN FINO***](https://vampire-survivors.fandom.com/wiki/MissingN%E2%96%AF)

### ***Key Mapping: Solve Key direction is opposite to the movement direction.***

#### Since the characteristic of MissingN is a random value, once the speed is less than -100% then it will cause the keys and movement direction to be opposite. I changed the Home key to Down, End to Up, Delete to Right, and Page Down to Left. As shown in the picture.

### ***Invicible Vampire(~~Except Wihte Hand~~)*** Only Support 1920 * 1080 Resolution.

#### Because MissingN starts with a random value each time, so there is a probability of opening a negative Max Health. (Negative Max Health, and then how to reduce the number of negative, about the same as invincible) but also because it is random, sometimes need to reopen many times. To solve this problem, I realized that I only need to press the Ins(Insert) key on the **interface of character selection** to fully automate Find Negative Max Health.

#### **Ins(Insert) keyis at the red circle on the picture**

#### Max Health is - 2.

#### ***How to force quit the function Press the PgUp key on the keyboard, as shown in the red circle on the picture.(essentially reloading the script)***

#### PS: If you find that the Ins key does not work, try Ctrl+Ins, although the implementation speed will be slower, but can be added to each cycle to determine whether there is a choice on MissingN.
